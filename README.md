# Flipkart-Price-Drop-Web-Scrapping-Python-Project

💻 Flipkart Price Drop Web Scrapping Project using Python 💻

In the quest for my perfect laptop, I embarked on a tech-savvy journey, and I can't wait to share the details with you all! 🎉

Last month, my trusty old laptop decided it was time to retire, and so began the hunt for a worthy replacement. After countless hours of research and contemplation, I finally settled on the DELL Inspiron Core i5 11th Gen 1135G7 – a laptop that seemed tailor-made for my coding and research needs. But I noticed that the laptop's price was as dynamic as the tech world itself, fluctuating daily on one of my favourite online platforms, Flipkart. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and built a Python project that would help me strike the best deal!

Here's what my web scrapping project does:

1️⃣ **Web Scraping Magic**: I kick-started my project by extracting crucial information from the Flipkart webpage. This included the product title, its price, and the current date. 📅

2️⃣ **Data Collection**: The extracted data was then meticulously saved and appended into my system, forming a dataset that would serve as the cornerstone of my quest for savings. 💾 

3️⃣ **Price Watchdog**: The "Price Checking Function" checks the laptop's price every day for an entire month. 📈

4️⃣ **Mail Alert**: The moment the price drops below my desired value, i.e, Rs 54000, this function sends a mail 🚨💰

So, why am I sharing this? Well, because this journey taught me that with a little coding and innovation, we can make better decisions while purchasing.
